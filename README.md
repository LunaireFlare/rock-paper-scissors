# [The Odin Project Foundations Course: Rock, Paper, Scissors game]
## Overview

The [rock paper scissors project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors) is the first of the JavaScript section, and kickstarts the learning of programming basics with creating a browser game of **rock, paper, scissors**.

## Description
**Live version**: available [here](https://lunaireflare.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/).

Intended as a first dive into JavaScript programming, the project was divided into two distinct phases: 1) a console-only game, and 2) a finished browser game with a GUI. This version, called ``Boulder, Codex, Longsword``, offers a medieval, classic rpg twist on the traditional game. 

The goal was to get a first glimpse at algorithmic logic and how functions interact with one another. For a complete beginner, it was harder than it looked, although the feeling wasn't helped by certain UI choices (icon/button-reliant instead of text, *many* parts to update depending on outcomes). Overall quite challenging on the programming side, but a good introduction to it, although many notions remain to be consolidated, and the code needs optimized.

### Features
- Medieval-themed rock, paper, scissors game with classic RPG twist
- Visual interface with icon/button-based player and opponent selection
- Score tracking with best-of-five-rounds winner system
- Replay button resetting scores for a new game

### Practiced Skills
- Basic and anonymous functions, conditional statements and loops
- Function order and calling, variable scopes
- Breaking down of functions into smaller components
- Console interaction and styling
- DOM manipulation, event listeners
- Flexbox layout and CSS transitions
- Git branching and merging

### Encountered Pitfalls
- Infinite recursion and loops occurred *very* frequently
- Tripped up on asynchronous functions  (ultimately solved with a ``Promise``) and function order for a good while
- Replacing the opponent's icon based on its choice proved more difficult than anticipated
- Console debugging and breakpoints remain a bit obscure
